# [CS] Kirby Deluxe!

Play as the pink puffball warrior with a moveset directly inspired by **Kirby and the Forgotten Land (2022)**, made to align within Kirby's N64 era!

This mod features:
* Copy abilities in the form of the base game's power-ups, with Copy Ability Essences replacing the cap models!
* Custom objects for the Air and Star bullets!
* Comes with both "Normal" and "Classic" costumes!
* A host-only configuration that allows Kirby to puff up infinitely, perfect for ROM-hacks!
* An API that allows modders to add objects for Kirby to inhale through LUA functions!

# Inhale API

To hook a custom object for Kirby to inhale, or if you want to edit an existing object, you first need to have its behavior ID, once you've obtained it, you can proceed with adding these functions;

## _G.kirbyInhaleHookBehavior
`_G.kirbyInhaleHookBehavior` allows the modder to hook a custom behavior for Kirby to inhale.

### Parameters
